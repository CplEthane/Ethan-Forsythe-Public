Pac-Man 6280:  An example of the code for this arcade-accurate port of Pac-Man for the 6280 FPGA platform. This is not the up-to-date code, that's in a private repository. ANSI C and assembler. 

Raylib VN Repeating Background:  The demonstration of a seamless repeating background for a car sprite to stationarily drive upon. Raylib, ANSI C. 

Quest Procedural Generator: Using Raylib, ANSI C. This creates a simple island in an ocean using Dragon Quest tiles. Every island is randomly generated to nearly fit the screen, each tangible island is counted, two rivers are plotted, and then a DFS is employed to create a road across the island.
